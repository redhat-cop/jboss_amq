A role to install JBoss AMQ on RHEL7. Intended to be used with [JBoss Middleware Playbooks](https://github.com/rhtconsulting/ansible-middleware-playbooks)

Transfer Method

This role supports a few different mechanism for transferring the product zip files to the target host. These are documented on [the main playbooks README](https://github.com/rhtconsulting/ansible-middleware-playbooks), as the methods are supported across a variety of roles.


Dependencies
------------
